# ICES-NVS_mappings
With the exception of mappings between the ICES Platform codes on the NVS as collection C17 and in the ICES vocabualry collections which are managed via a very formal process, other mappings between NVS and ICES concepts are being worked on on an ad-hoc 
basis for the time being. If required, please request new mappings by raising an issue ticket mentioning the NVS source and ICES target vocabulary and term.
